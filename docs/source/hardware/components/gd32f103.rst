GD32F103 MCU
============
The GD32F103 looks like a clone of the STM32F103 pin compatible and mostly register compatible, 
but with difference clock speed. It's able to run at 108 MHz instead of 72MHz (STM32F1).

The platform.io system also uses the a definition for STM32F103 for building the firmware.
See https://github.com/ANYCUBIC-3D/framework-arduinoststm32_vyper/blob/main/ac_tri_f103re.json

This would lead to the following minimum specs (taken from STM32F103RET6 Datasheet)
