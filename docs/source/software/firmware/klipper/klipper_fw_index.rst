================

General
-------

At time of beginning that project, I got not to much information about the Klipper firmware.

Informations about Klipper can be found on their Webpage: https://www.klipper3d.org/



Installation and Usage
----------------------

There is a series of youtube videos which shows the modifications on a Anycubic Vyper Printer.
One of the changes is usage and installation of Klipper.

Getting Help
------------

On Discord https://discord.com/channels/693899722532061316/927949463241236501 there is very active and nice group that helps out with 
many problems arround the Anycubic Vyper and Klipper.

It's a german group, so don't wonder that most stuff is hold in german in that Discord server, but english speaking peoples are also welcome.

The youtuber that made the Tweaking Videos above can also be found on the Discord server.
