Klipper Firmware
================

General
-------

At time of beginning that project, I got not to much information about the Klipper firmware.

Informations about Klipper can be found on their Webpage: https://www.klipper3d.org/



Installation and Usage
----------------------

There is a series of youtube videos which shows the modifications on a Anycubic Vyper Printer.
One of the changes is usage and installation of Klipper.
