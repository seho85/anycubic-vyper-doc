Klipper Firmware
================

General
-------

At time of beginning that project, I got not to much information about the Klipper firmware.

But the general approach of the Klipper firmware is two a two tier concept.

Use the MCU from the mainboard of the 3D printer, to control the printer peripherals (stepper driver a.s.o.) and do the more
cpu intesive stuff on a second (more powerfull) machine. It's very popular to use Raspberry PIs as this second machine.

There is also a project called Mainsail OS (https://docs.mainsail.xyz/setup/mainsail-os) which bundles everything needed to 
your printer with klipper and much more stuff.

Informations about Klipper can be found on their Webpage: https://www.klipper3d.org/


Installation and Usage
----------------------

There is a series of youtube videos which shows the modifications on a Anycubic Vyper Printer.
One of the changes is usage and installation of Klipper.
